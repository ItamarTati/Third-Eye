'teamBio' : `Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter developed and published by Blizzard 
              Entertainment and released on May 24, 2016 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. Described as a "hero shooter", 
              Overwatch assigns players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a roster of 31 characters, known as 
              "heroes", each with a unique style of play whose roles are divided into three general categories that fit their role. 
              Players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map or escort a payload across the map in a 
              limited amount of time. Players gain cosmetic rewards that do not affect gameplay, such as character skins and victory 
              poses, as they play the game. The game was initially launched with casual play, with a competitive ranked mode, various
              'arcade' game modes, and a player-customizable server browser subsequently included following its release. Additionally, 
              Blizzard has added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charge, with the only additional cost 
              to players being optional loot boxes to earn cosmetic items.`,

        She has no interest in global conquest, but is willing to work with those who might have such a goal. 
        Her intellectual pursuits are driven by her interest in humanity. She is a geneticist first and foremost, and 
        that's the scope of her ambition. With very flexible morals, O'Deorain prefers to focus on her research and 
        has no patience for those who urge caution or restraint. Her right hand is heavily scarred; it has been
